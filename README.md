#Agentic LLM Tool to Help Consume Electricity Wisely to Support Grid Decarbonisation


Electricity grids are undergoing a fundamental transformation as renewable energy sources like wind and solar replace dirtier fuels. However, renewables are intermittent - the sun doesn't always shine, and the wind doesn't always blow. This creates a mismatch between when clean energy is available and when consumers use electricity.


The core problem is that most consumers have no visibility and knowledge into the carbon intensity of their electricity at any given moment. They run dishwashers, charge EVs, and heat water without knowing whether that power comes from wind turbines or oil/gas peakers. This blind consumption undermines grid decarbonisation efforts and increases costs rather than helping it.
